        "description": "## About\n\nJupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users access to computational environments and resources without burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks. Users - including students, researchers, and data scientists - can get their work done in their own workspaces on shared resources which can be managed efficiently by system administrators.\n\n## Notebook container image\n\nThis app uses the [data science](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-datascience-notebook)\nnotebook image by default. This image is ~2GB and is downloaded during\napp startup. This can take a bit of time depending on the network speed.\n\nThe Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you\nto create and share documents that contain live code, equations,\nvisualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and\ntransformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization,\nmachine learning, and much more.\n\n## Features\n\n* Language of choice - Python, R, Julia, and Scala\n* In-browser editing for code, with automatic syntax highlighting, indentation, and tab completion/introspection.\n* The ability to execute code from the browser, with the results of computations attached to the code which generated them.\n* Displaying the result of computation using rich media representations, such as HTML, LaTeX, PNG, SVG, etc. For example, publication-quality figures rendered by the matplotlib library, can be included inline.\n* In-browser editing for rich text using the Markdown markup language, which can provide commentary for the code, is not limited to plain text.\n* The ability to easily include mathematical notation within markdown cells using LaTeX, and rendered natively by MathJax.\n\n",
