Communicate the way you want with\nElement - a universal secure chat app entirely under your control.\n\nWhether you’re a team, a family, a community.\n\nWhether you’re after one-to-one chats, small private groups, big public ones.\n\nWhether you want to be visible to attract more members, flexible to gather users across different entities and apps, independent and confidential to keep your privacy.\n\nOr if you’re after all of these at the same time. Element is where you’ll feel at home. Join or create rooms per topic, per group, per event.\n\nDecide the level of access control you want to provide (invite only, if one has the link, public), how visible the history should be. Create your own private communities to group your rooms by topic and filter them.\n\nDark theme or light theme - make Element your own!\n\n## Features\n\n* Choose who you trust with your data\n* Share Files\n* Intelligent Notifications\n* Other Apps, Stickers, Widgets & Bots\n* Bridge other apps and networks\n* Open Source & Open Standard - Open source, and built on Matrix.
