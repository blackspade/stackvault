        "description": "## About\n\nPrometheus, a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project, is a systems and service monitoring system.\nIt collects metrics from configured targets at given intervals, evaluates rule expressions, displays\nthe results, and can trigger alerts when specified conditions are observed.\n\n## Features\n\nThe features that distinguish Prometheus from other metrics and monitoring systems are:\n\n* A multi-dimensional data model (time series defined by metric name and set of key/value dimensions)\n* PromQL, a powerful and flexible query language to leverage this dimensionality\n* No dependency on distributed storage; single server nodes are autonomous\n* An HTTP pull model for time series collection\n* Pushing time series is supported via an intermediary gateway for batch jobs\n* Targets are discovered via service discovery or static configuration\n* Multiple modes of graphing and dashboarding support\n* Support for hierarchical and horizontal federation\n\n",
