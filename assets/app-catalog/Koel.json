        "description": "Koel (also stylized as koel, with a lowercase k) is a simple web-based personal audio streaming service written in Vue on the client side and Laravel on the server side. Targeting web developers, Koel embraces some of the more modern web technologies – CSS grid, audio, and drag-and-drop API to name a few – to do its job.\n\n\n## The Story of Koel\n\nMy laptop went out of disk space – thank you, Parallels.\nMy phone has only 16GB of storage.\nAnd I still have a good 40GB of mp3 stored in my external hard drive.\nSo I started looking out for an open source, or at least free, music streaming application that I can make use of.\nI found a few. Alas, none was good enough!\nIn my desperation I asked myself this question:\n\"Heck, why not build one?\"\nAnd so koel was born.\n\nAnd why \"koel\"?\nIt’s the name of a bird who sings non-stop near my place back in Singapore.\n\n",
