        "changelog": "* Update 2FAuth to 6.0.0\n* [Full Changelog](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/releases/tag/v6.0.0)\n* 2FAuth can now fetch icons from offline icon packs. Visit the new [Icon documentation page](https://docs.2fauth.app/usage/icons) to learn how to set them up ([#203](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/203)).\n* The sort order of 2FA accounts is saved to user preferences when changed from the Manage mode. This allows the account list to be reordered automatically after a new account is registered. ([#377](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/377)).\n* Groups can be reordered (manually, from the Group management view) ([#419](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/419)).\n* A new filter is available to only show 2FA accounts that do not belong to any group ([#430](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/430)).\n* The Import feature now supports Bitwarden export ([#501](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/501)).\n* Group names now accept single quote ([#465](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/465)).\n* Upon logging out, users are now redirected to the last login form they used: Password, SSO or Webauthn. ([#478](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/478)).\n* Catchable errors that occur during the sending of a test email are now displayed in the UI to help you understand what's going on.\n* [issue #447](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/447) Unable to import Google Authenticator.\n* [issue #464](https://github.com/Bubka/2FAuth/issues/464) Import error not correctly reported in the GUI.\n",
