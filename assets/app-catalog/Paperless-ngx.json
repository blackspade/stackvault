        "description": "### About\n\nPaperless-ngx is an application that manages your personal documents. With the help of a document scanner (see Scanner recommendations),\npaperless transforms your wieldy physical document binders into a searchable archive and provides many utilities for finding and managing your documents.\n\n### Why This Exists\n\nPaper is a nightmare. Environmental issues aside, there’s no excuse for it in the 21st century.\nIt takes up space, collects dust, doesn’t support any form of a search feature, indexing is tedious, it’s heavy and prone to damage & loss.\n\nI wrote this to make “going paperless” easier. I do not have to worry about finding stuff again.\nI feed documents right from the post box into the scanner and then shred them. Perhaps you might find it useful too.\n\n### Paperless-ngx\n\nPaperless-ngx forked from paperless-ng to continue the great work and distribute responsibility of supporting and advancing the project among a team of people.\n\n",
