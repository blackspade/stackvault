        "description": "## About\n\nOpen Source Identity and Access Management. Add authentication to applications and secure services with minimum effort. No need to deal with storing users or authenticating users.\n\nKeycloak provides user federation, strong authentication, user management, fine-grained authorization, and more.\n\n## Features\n\n* Single-Sign On - Users authenticate with Keycloak rather than individual applications. This means that your applications don't have to deal with login forms, authenticating users, and storing users. Once logged-in to Keycloak, users don't have to login again to access a different application.\n\n* Single-Sign On - Users authenticate with Keycloak rather than individual applications. This means that your applications don't have to deal with login forms, authenticating users, and storing users. Once logged-in to Keycloak, users don't have to login again to access a different application.\n\n* User Federation - Keycloak has built-in support to connect to existing LDAP or Active Directory servers. You can also implement your own provider if you have users in other stores, such as a relational database.\n\n* Standard Protocols - Keycloak is based on standard protocols and provides support for OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML.\n",
