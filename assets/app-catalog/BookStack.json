        "description": "## About\n\nBookStack is an opinionated wiki system that provides a pleasant and simple out\nof the box experience. New users to an instance should find the experience intuitive\nand only basic word-processing skills should be required to get involved in creating\ncontent on BookStack. The platform should provide advanced power features to those that desire it, but they should not interfere with the core simple user experience.\n\nBookStack is not designed as an extensible platform to be used for purposes that differ to the statement above.\n\nIn regard to development philosophy, BookStack has a relaxed, open & positive approach. We aim to slowly yet continuously evolve the platform while providing a stable & easy upgrade path.\n\n## Feature\n\n* Free & Open Source\n* Easy, Simple Interface\n* Configurable\n* Multi-lingual\n* Integrated Authentication\n\n",
