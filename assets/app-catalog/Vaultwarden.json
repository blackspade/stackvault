        "description": "### Overview\n\nThis is the Rust implementation of the Bitwarden backend, *not* the official server backend, but fully compatible with the Client apps.\n\nVaultwarden is a self-hosted password manager. It allows you to store and manage your passwords, credit cards, and other private information in a secure way while still allowing you to access it from your browser, phone, or desktop.\n\n### Client Apps\n\nThe official client apps from bitwarden.com are all supported. In fact the webfrontend, packaged together with this app, is also the official one.\n\nClients can be downloaded at [bitwarden.com](https://bitwarden.com/#download)\n\nThose apps are a lot of effort to maintain, so please consider supporting the upstream project.\n",
