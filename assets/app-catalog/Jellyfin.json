        "description": "### Overview\n\nJellyfin is a Free Software Media System that puts you in control of managing and streaming your media.\nIt is an alternative to the proprietary Emby and Plex, to provide media from a dedicated server to end-user devices via multiple apps.\nJellyfin is descended from Emby's 3.5.2 release and ported to the .NET Core framework to enable full cross-platform support.\nThere are no strings attached, no premium licenses or features, and no hidden agendas: just a team who want to build something better and work together to achieve it.\n\nWe welcome anyone who is interested in joining us in our quest!\n",
