        "description": "## About\n\nThe best and simplest self-hosted free open source website change detection monitoring and notification service. An alternative to Visualping, Watchtower etc. Designed for simplicity - the main goal is to simply monitor which websites had a text change for free.\n\n## Features\n\n* Lots of trigger filters, such as \"Trigger on text\", \"Remove text by selector\", \"Ignore text\", \"Extract text\", also using regular-expressions!\n* Target elements with xPath 1 and xPath 2, CSS Selectors, Easily monitor complex JSON with JSONPath or jq\n* Switch between fast non-JS and Chrome JS based \"fetchers\"\n* Track changes in PDF files (Monitor text changed in the PDF, Also monitor PDF filesize and checksums)\n* Easily specify how often a site should be checked\n* Execute JS before extracting text (Good for logging in, see examples in the UI!)\n* Override Request Headers, Specify POST or GET and other methods\n* Use the \"Visual Selector\" to help target specific elements\n* Configurable proxy per watch\n* Send a screenshot with the notification when a change is detected in the web page\n\n## Example use cases\n\n- Products and services have a change in pricing\n- Governmental department updates (changes are often only on their websites)\n- New software releases, security advisories when you're not on their mailing list.\n- Festivals with changes\n- Realestate listing changes\n- Know when your favourite whiskey is on sale, or other special deals are announced before anyone else\n- COVID related news from government websites\n- University/organisation news from their website\n- Detect and monitor changes in JSON API responses \n- JSON API monitoring and alerting\n- Changes in legal and other documents\n- Trigger API calls via notifications when text appears on a website\n- Glue together APIs using the JSON filter and JSON notifications\n- Create RSS feeds based on changes in web content\n- Monitor HTML source code for unexpected changes, strengthen your PCI compliance\n- You have a very sensitive list of URLs to watch and you do _not_ want to use the paid alternatives. (Remember, _you_ are the product)\n\n",
